# Overview

Looker is a powerful BI tool that allows users to build, analyze, and share real-time data. Meaning, once your data is synced into this block, the data visualizations will always be current and manipulated as needed. This is useful for two primary reasons, first the data is presented in a readable form and allows straightforward analysis. And secondly, it will empower your company to understand user behavior, sales trends, and inventory flows. This block is intended to cover three use cases:

### Traffic Summary
* This answers how users are behaving on your site, such as: how many are visiting and of that amount, how many are new users or repeated users?
* See the geographic locations of users, the devices they are using, and how long are they engaged 
* See where users are coming from and how many are converting

### Sales Summary
* Shows an overview of sales and orders trends and overall averages of items ordered, order value, etc.
* See totals for items that should be top of mind, such as Shopify Baseball Bomber Grey
* See the buying behaviors of new and repeated customers

### Inventory Trends / Logs
* See inventory flows over time and the net changes
* See what your inventory flows are by product and variant
* See inventory logs to scope a full audit and to look for current levels
